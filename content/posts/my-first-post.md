title: 'Why I Built My Website with Hugo'
---

Hi there! I want to share why I chose Hugo to build this corner of the internet. It's a decision that's shaped how I approach content creation and web development, and I think you might find it interesting.

For those unfamiliar, Hugo is a static site generator that turns your content into blazing-fast websitesâ€”it's as cool as it sounds! Think of it as a super-efficient website builder that focuses on speed and simplicity.

My journey with Hugo started during one of those late-night coding sessions when I was rebuilding my portfolio (again). I had tried various platforms before, but nothing quite clicked. That's when I stumbled upon Hugo, and it changed everything.

## What Made Me Choose Hugo?

Creating the "perfect" personal website has been a bit of an obsession of mine. My first attempts used raw code, but I wanted something that felt more... me.

Hugo stood out for several reasons:
* It's incredibly fast at building sites (we're talking milliseconds)
* Content creation is straightforward using Markdown
* There's zero server maintenance to worry about
* Hosting is free through GitHub Pages
* The theme system is flexible and powerful
* The community is active and supportive

## The Learning Process

Let me get to the point about learning Hugo:

1. The documentation is surprisingly good and beginner-friendly
2. There's an active Discord community ready to help
3. You can learn by looking at other Hugo sites' source code
4. Starting with a pre-made theme helps you understand the basics
5. Version control with Git makes tracking changes easy

What I love most about Hugo is how it lets me focus on writing rather than fighting with technical issues. That is..after I was figuring out how to install the requirements necessary to get it up and running. When I want to publish a new post, I just write in Markdown, run a simple command, and it's live. No database maintenance, no security updates, no hassle.

## What's Next?

This site is my attempt to process and share ideas with the world. Hugo makes it easy to maintain a blog, documentation, and portfolio all in one place. Soon, you'll find more articles about tech, tutorials, and random musings on whatever I'm diving into at the moment.

It's also been a great excuse to learn more about static site generators and modern web development practices. The journey of learning Hugo has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm excited to see where this platform takes me.

If you're thinking about building your own website, give Hugo a shot. You might just find your new favorite tool!
