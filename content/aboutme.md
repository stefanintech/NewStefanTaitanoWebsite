Hi there! I'm Stefan Taitano, and welcome to my corner of the internet. This site is a space where I share my thoughts on technology, chess, productivity, and more. It’s also a hub for my creative projects and interests.

Professionally, I work as a ServiceNow Technical Consultant at [Thirdera](https://www.thirdera.com/), where I help organizations streamline and automate their workflows. I’m also proud to lead the up-and-coming ServiceNow Veterans in Tech group, a community initiative that’s launching soon. Before diving into tech, I served in the United States Army as a Fire Control Specialist, taking on roles like Team Lead, Program Manager, and Retention Manager. These days, I call Minnesota home.

For those unfamiliar, [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/what-is-servicenow.html) is a SaaS platform designed to automate and manage business processes—it’s as cool as it sounds!

Outside of work, I’m a big fan of podcasts and audiobooks, slowly but surely working my way through my ever-growing list. When I’m not learning something new, you’ll probably find me gaming. I love video games like Marvel Rivals, Phasmophobia, and Age of Empires, as well as board games like Chess, My First Castle Panic, and Hive.

## What’s This Site About?

Creating the "perfect" personal website has been a bit of an obsession of mine. My first attempt, [Stefantaitano.dev](https://stefantaitano.dev/), was simple and straightforward, but I wanted something that felt more... me.

This site is my attempt to process and share ideas with the world. Soon, you’ll find articles, tutorials, and random musings on whatever I’m diving into at the moment. My hope is that you’ll discover something useful—or at least interesting—along the way.

It’s also been a great excuse to teach myself [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the static site generator powering this site.
